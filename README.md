1. Technologies/dependiencies used: Java 17, Gradle 7.6, Lombok, JUnit 5, Rest-Assured, GSON, Allure Reports, Logback
2. Test should run from IDE as usual
3. You can execute tests by tags by changing method to tag in run configuration
4. Allure reports are applied but they are empty for some reason so instead use basic reports in build/reports (index.html)
